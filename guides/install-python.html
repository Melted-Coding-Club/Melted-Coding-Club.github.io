        <h3>What is Python?</h3>
        <p>
            Python is a programming language used to create scripts and applications.
            It is one of the most popular programming languages today because of its simplicity, readability, and strong community support.
            Python allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than complex syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.
        </p>

        <p>
            Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line by line.
            This makes it easier to debug and experiment, allowing programmers to see the results of their code quickly.
            Python's ecosystem includes a vast collection of libraries for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although Python may not be the fastest language in execution speed, its ease of use, rapid development capabilities, and strong community support outweigh these drawbacks.
            Most importantly, learning Python builds problem-solving skills essential for programming in any language.

        <h3>How Python Works</h3>
        <p>
            Python is an interpreted language, which means that its code is executed line by line by an <strong>interpreter</strong>.
            Unlike compiled languages (such as C++ or Java), where the entire code is translated into machine language before execution, Python translates and runs the code simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach provides several advantages:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ease of Debugging:</strong> Errors are shown as they occur, making it easier to identify and fix bugs.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Python's interactive shell allows programmers to test code snippets in real-time, which is excellent for learning and experimentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Python code can run on any operating system with a compatible interpreter (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, because Python is interpreted line by line, it can be slower in execution compared to compiled languages.
            Nevertheless, its simplicity and rapid development capabilities make it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.

        <h3>Installing Python on macOS</h3>
        <p>
            macOS comes with an older version of Python pre-installed, but it is recommended to install the latest version to access the newest features and security updates.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Check if Python is Installed:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open Terminal and type: <code>python3 --version</code></li>
                    <li>If a version is displayed, Python is already installed. If not, proceed to the next step.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Download the Latest Version:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/" target="_blank">Python.org Downloads for macOS</a></li>
                    <li>Download the latest version compatible with your macOS.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Install Python:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the downloaded package and follow the installation instructions.</li>
                    <li>Make sure to check the option to add Python to your PATH during installation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Verify the Installation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open Terminal and type: <code>python3 --version</code></li>
                    <li>You should see the version number of the Python you just installed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Install pip (Python Package Manager):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>pip is included with the latest versions of Python. To verify, type: <code>pip3 --version</code></li>
                    <li>If not installed, you can install it manually using: <code>sudo easy_install pip</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Congratulations! You have successfully installed Python on macOS and are now ready to start coding.
